### This repository contains User Defined Functions or user subroutines based in C language.
UDFs are defined using DEFINE macros provided by ANSYS FLUENT. They are coded using additional macros and functions also supplied by ANSYS FLUENT that access ANSYS FLUENT solver data and perform other tasks. Source files containing UDFs can be either interpreted or compiled in ANSYS FLUENT. For interpreted UDFs, source files are interpreted and loaded directly at runtime, in a single-step process. For compiled UDFs, the process involves two separate steps. A shared object code library is first built and then it is loaded into ANSYS FLUENT. After being interpreted or compiled, UDFs will become visible and selectable in ANSYS FLUENT dialog boxes, and can be hooked to a solver by choosing the function name in the appropriate dialog box.
